# window-creating
# I have written a program for creating a window of your own using wxPython. 
# The program runs smoothly, except that what I write into the text created with this program can't be 
#stored as characters, but as some sort of source text. As I am using the Python 3.6 version as Pycharm's interpretor,
#whether it is a compatibility issue remains to be explored.
